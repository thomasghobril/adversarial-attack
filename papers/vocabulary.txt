ACAS = Airborne Collision Avoidance System

NAS = National Airspace System

NMAC = Near Mid-Air Collision (when an aircraft enters the collision volume of another)
MAC = Mid-Air Collision (when there is a real collision between two aircrafts)
CPA = Closest Point of Approach (point in space where the distance between aircrafts is minimum when considering constant velocity vector = straight motion)
ADS-B = Automatic Dependant Surveillance-Broadcast (cooperative positioning system for aircraft using GPS)

SMT = Satisfiability Modulo Theories
